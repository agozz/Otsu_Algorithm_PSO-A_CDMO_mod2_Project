# Otsu's Algorithm with PSO - A Combinatorial Decision Making and Optimization (module 2) Project

This is the project I did for my Combinatorial Decision Making and Optimization (module 2) exam. It consists in the implementation of the Otsu's algorithm, which is used to segment images adopting a threshold, through the Particle Swarm Optimization method. The objective is to compute the optimal threshold in less time than the original approach, optimizing the search for such threshold.
